## Description

| Code | Description                                  |
|------|----------------------------------------------|
| abf | additive benefit function|
| mam | mammal distributions, modelled (see Rondinini et al. 2011)|
| hms | hierarchical mask, protected areas|
| dsc | connectivity using distribution smoothing, species specific|
| dsa | connectivity using distribution smoothing, using arbitrary kernels|
| bcc | betweenness centrality connectivity|
| plu | planning units, protected areas as planning units, the layer is produced based on [link to the decision rule] |
